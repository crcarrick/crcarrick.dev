[React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org) is the "Official React bindings for Redux". In this post, we'll learn how to create our own React Redux and in doing so, hopefully gain a better understanding of how it all works under the hood.

## Before Reading

You should be relatively familiar with the following tools and concepts:

- React
- React's [Context API]()
- React's [Hooks API]()
- [Redux]()
- [Create React App]()

## Setup & Installation

We'll be using a fresh Create React App project as the base for this exercise. Additionally, we'll be using Redux for our store and RxJS to subscribe to changes to the store's state.

  Don't worry if you're not familiar with RxJS. We're only going to be using one function to subscribe to the Redux store, and I'll explain how it works when we get there. If you'd like to learn more about RxJS before we continue, you can do so <a href="">here</a>.

When you're ready, go ahead and run the following commands in your terminal:

```shell { "copy": "npx create-react-app react-medux && cd react-medux && yarn add redux rxjs && code ./" }
# create the project
npx create-react-app react-medux
# install dependencies
cd react-medux && yarn add redux rxjs
# open the project in vscode
code ./
```

## Project Structure

Let's go ahead create a folder inside the `src` directory and call it `react-medux`.
